		<p>Thanks to its simple and accessible user experience, Arduino has been used in thousands of different projects and applications. 
			The Arduino software is easy-to-use for beginners, yet flexible enough for advanced users. It runs on Mac, Windows, and Linux. 
			Teachers and students use it to build low cost scientific instruments, to prove chemistry and physics principles, or to get started 
			with programming and robotics. Designers and architects build interactive prototypes, musicians and artists use it for installations 
			and to experiment with new musical instruments. Makers, of course, use it to build many of the projects exhibited at the Maker Faire, 
			for example. Arduino is a key tool to learn new things. Anyone - children, hobbyists, artists, programmers - can start tinkering just 
			following the step by step instructions of a kit, 
			or sharing ideas online with other members of the Arduino community.</p>
		<p>There are many other microcontrollers and microcontroller platforms available for physical computing. 
			Parallax Basic Stamp, Netmedia's BX-24, Phidgets, MIT's Handyboard, and many others offer similar functionality. 
			All of these tools take the messy details of microcontroller programming and wrap it up in an easy-to-use package. 
			Arduino also simplifies the process of working with microcontrollers, but it offers some advantage for teachers, students, 
			and interested amateurs over other systems:</p>
		<p>On <time datetime="2017-04-04">30 April 2020</time>, Sir Tim was awarded the ACM A.M. Turing Prize for inventing the World Wide Web, the first web browser, and the fundamental protocols and algorithms allowing the Web to scale. The Turing Prize, called the "Nobel Prize of Computing" is considered one of the most prestigious awards in Computer Science.</p>
