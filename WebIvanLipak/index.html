		<p class="p1">
			Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. 
			Arduino boards are able to read inputs - light on a sensor, a finger on a button, or a Twitter message - 
			and turn it into an output - activating a motor, turning on an LED, publishing something online. You can tell your board 
			what to do by sending a set of instructions to the microcontroller on the board. To do so you use the Arduino programming language 
			(based on Wiring), and the Arduino Software (IDE), based on Processing.</p>
			<p class="p1">
			Over the years Arduino has been the brain of thousands of projects, from everyday objects to 
			complex scientific instruments. A worldwide community of makers - students, hobbyists, artists, programmers, 
			and professionals - has gathered around this open-source platform, their contributions have added up to an incredible 
			amount of accessible knowledge that can be of great help to novices and experts alike.</p>
			<p class="p1">
			Arduino was born at the Ivrea Interaction Design Institute as an easy tool for fast prototyping, 
			aimed at students without a background in electronics and programming. As soon as it reached a wider community, 
			the Arduino board started changing to adapt to new needs and challenges, differentiating its offer from simple 8-bit 
			boards to products for IoT applications, wearable, 3D printing, and embedded environments. All Arduino boards are completely 
			open-source, empowering users to build them independently and eventually adapt them to their particular needs. The software, 
			too, is open-source, and it is growing through the contributions of users worldwide.</p>
